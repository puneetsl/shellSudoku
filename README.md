About

This code is classic example of how to write a bad code, that works almost perfectly. I wrote it while learning Arrays, Shell, GCC, Sudoku and most importantly C, hence the mess up.</br>
Otherwise this program is a beauty, I used to play lots of sudoku on it, even creating my own sudoku problems, saving it for later use.
