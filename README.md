About
----

This code is classic example of how to write a bad code, that works almost perfectly. I wrote it while learning Arrays, Shell, GCC, Sudoku and most importantly C, hence the mess up.</br>
Otherwise this program is a beauty, I used to play lots of sudoku on it, even creating my own sudoku problems, saving it for later use.

Features
----

* Ability to move across the grid using up, down, left, right keys.
* Giving suggestions for possible values of any given position.
* Checking your solution.
* Saving game for playing later.
* Creating your own Sudoku problem.
* Current setup works only in Mac, a small code change would port this to Linux and Windows.
